üíª Code Example
python
Copy code
import pyautogui
import pyperclip
import time
from openai import OpenAI

client = OpenAI(api_key="<Your API Key Here>")

def is_last_message_from_sender(chat_log, sender_name="Rohan Das"):
    messages = chat_log.strip().split("/2024] ")[-1]
    return sender_name in messages

pyautogui.click(1639, 1412)  # Click on chat window
time.sleep(1)

while True:
    time.sleep(5)
    pyautogui.moveTo(972, 202)
    pyautogui.dragTo(2213, 1278, duration=2.0, button='left')  # Drag to select text
    pyautogui.hotkey('ctrl', 'c')  # Copy text
    chat_history = pyperclip.paste()
    
    if is_last_message_from_sender(chat_history):
        completion = client.chat.completions.create(
            model="gpt-3.5-turbo",
            messages=[
                {"role": "system", "content": "You are a funny, witty coder who analyzes chats and gives humorous replies."},
                {"role": "user", "content": chat_history}
            ]
        )
        response = completion.choices[0].message.content
        pyperclip.copy(response)
        pyautogui.click(1808, 1328)  # Click to focus on message input
        pyautogui.hotkey('ctrl', 'v')  # Paste the AI response
        pyautogui.press('enter')  # Send message
